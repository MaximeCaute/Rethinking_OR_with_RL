- [Link to the article - under license](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8793143)

The authors use a distributed method, which means that agents do not anticipate the behavior of others.
Furthermore, their methods allows for ride-sharing between several customers.
They also used convolutional NN for future demand.
