### DONE

#### Bibliography
- Consultation of 14 variously related papers
- Detailed reading of a 2007 problem presentation & state-of-the-art survey (Laporte & Cordeau)
- Detailed reading of a summary of the incentive project  (Stocco & Alahi)
- Reading of recent, closely related article: Deep Pool (Al-Abbasi & al.)
- Reading of a genetic algorithm 2007 approach for DaRP (Bergvinsdottir & al.)

#### Code
- Code setup
- Code running for trouble shooting
- Minor code reading
- Pytorch training

### TODO

#### Generic
- Preparing a presentation of the project (understanding exercise)

#### Bibliography
- Further search for closely related articles (e.g. "*Imitating OR with RL*")
  - Especially, checking if no recent article are similar to our goals

#### Code
- Playing with the code to understand it
  - Trying to retrieve the precedent results
  - Trying different parameters configurations (ex: architecture)

#### Report
- Writing the "Related Work" section
